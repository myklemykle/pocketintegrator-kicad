pin needs:

buttons & po_wake must go on one of these to wake from deepSleep:
21, 22
(
	2,4,6,7,16,21,22
(,9)
(avoid 10,11,13)
(avoid 26,30,33)
)

po_wake seems to work on a digital pin but could be on a 'compare' pin (4,9,11)
9!

SPI uses these:
10, 11, 12, 13
(Or could use 7, 8, 9/15, 14)

digital out pins for audio jacks should be PWM capable, also have ADC:
20, 23
(only 20-23 have both)

(Not getting to pins >23 without some work ...)
