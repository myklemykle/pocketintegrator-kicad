Most of this mess is symbols (.lib), footprints (.kicad_mod) and 3D models (.step & others) 
for various board components.  Some of these components are no longer used,
and there are also some bogus paths to libraries in the KiCad config.
All of this will be better organized in the future.   Hopefully the KiCad
cache file contains all the models in use.

integrator.* are KiCad 5.x documents for eeschema, pcbnew & the other parts.

gerber/ contains the exported gerber files for fabrication.
